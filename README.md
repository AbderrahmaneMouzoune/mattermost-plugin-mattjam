## Introduction

### - Objective :
Our MattJam FOSS is an all-in-one plugin has so much functionnalities to hype your Mattermost sessions : 

* Full whiteboard creation with shapes, text, colors, post-its, arrow, and so much more
* You can add who can watch or edit the jam during the session
* You can download your jams and send them directly to everyone
* You can add a small resume of the session so everyone can remember or understand what happened during the jam session
* Jam versionning that allows you to look each versions of the same jam
* Resume system that save all the jams at the end of the session, and allows you to consult them at any time
* tag system to find easily any jam in your history with keywords
* reporting system so the admin can see what are MattJam stats 
* possibility to create call sessions in same time as jam sessions so there is no need of another plugin

Build your plugin:
```
make
```

This will produce a single plugin file (with support for multiple architectures) for upload to your Mattermost server:

```
dist/com.example.my-plugin.tar.gz
```

## Development

To avoid having to manually install your plugin, build and deploy your plugin using one of the following options.

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying your plugin. Edit your server configuration as follows:

```json
{
    "ServiceSettings": {
        ...
        "EnableLocalMode": true,
        "LocalModeSocketLocation": "/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket"
    }
}
```

and then deploy your plugin:
```
make deploy
```

You may also customize the Unix socket path:
```
export MM_LOCALSOCKETPATH=/var/tmp/alternate_local.socket
make deploy
```

If developing a plugin with a webapp, watch for changes and deploy those automatically:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make watch
```

### Deploying with credentials

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the server's API with credentials:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

or with a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```

## Q&A

### How do I make a server-only or web app-only plugin?

Simply delete the `server` or `webapp` folders and remove the corresponding sections from `plugin.json`. The build scripts will skip the missing portions automatically.

### How do I include assets in the plugin bundle?

Place them into the `assets` directory. To use an asset at runtime, build the path to your asset and open as a regular file:

```go
bundlePath, err := p.API.GetBundlePath()
if err != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to get bundle path")
}

profileImage, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filepath.Join(bundlePath, "assets", "profile_image.png"))
if err != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to read profile image")
}

if appErr := p.API.SetProfileImage(userID, profileImage); appErr != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to set profile image")
}
```

### How do I build the plugin with unminified JavaScript?
Setting the `MM_DEBUG` environment variable will invoke the debug builds. The simplist way to do this is to simply include this variable in your calls to `make` (e.g. `make dist MM_DEBUG=1`).
